# odin-landingpage-project
A project proposed by Odin Projet where knowledge in flexbox is reaffirmed

## problems encountered along the way

* Duplicate font import in index.css
   * solution: change the @import "variable" to @use "variable" as var
* Using flexbox I have not managed to align the text of the quote section in the same way as the reference image 
   *use padding-right to align the author but I don't know if it's the best way to do it
